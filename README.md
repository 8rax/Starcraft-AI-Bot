# Starcraft-AI-Bot
Building a Starcraft bot with deep learning

This repository stores my attempts at creating a Bot in Python for starctaft 2. I use Python-Sc2 for the first versions and then BurnySc2 release as it is more up to date. My bot competes on AiArena : https://aiarena.net/bots/202/ 

All first 5 versions are rules based. In the fifth version I introduced data capture. Next step would be to determine some actions in output that a neural network would weight using the images of our minimap as input. 

I am also considering switching to sharpysc2 which seems quite easier to implement. 

For a detailed tutorial on how to use the code above :

Good luck and En Taro Adun !
